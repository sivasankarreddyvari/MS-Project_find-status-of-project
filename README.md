DocOckMock Development Project

Background:
Octavius Technologies has finalized requirements for a new, direct, brain-computer interface module for cognitive enhancement. The module is beyond innovative in that the user, after neurosurgery to implant the module, will be able to configure the type and degree of cognitive enhancements using an external, hand-held device to be called a DocOckMock or simply "Mock". This device is similar in form to a smart phone; however, Octavius Technology decided against deploying the configuration software on a smart phone because of security concerns with obvious, tremendous ramifications. The Mock is to be connected to a PC or Mac via a USB for downloading software updates and cognitive add-on components from the Internet which can later be applied to the implant. The software for the uplink from the PC/Mac is called "Mock-up".

For instance, if you want to be an expert on British history, you will be able to purchase an "add-on" over the Internet using Mock-up software, load it to the Mock then u pload it to your implant.

You are the assistant project manager for the team to develop the configuration software for the external device. Briar Octavius, son of fonder Otto Octavius, is the lead project manager. Development of the implant and the software for the implant is nearing completion. Ig will use a secured, wireless communication channel between the DocOckMock and the implant. That development team has created inerface and communication specifications for the implant that must be used by the DocOckMock.

Rumors are rampant that NeuroLaunch, a competitor funded by entrepreneur Ethan Moss, is working on a similar device. There is pressure to be first-to-market with this cutting-eedge technology. Otto approved pre-development contracts for 25 units with a promised delivery date of August 3, 2020, the date of the next Octavius Technologies investors meeting, which he wants to expand into a launch party, setting the state for an IPO. He told Briar that if the team can not generate a plan to meet this deadline, funding will go to another group.

Briar requested that an outside testing group be employed prior to August 3rd to participate in a comprehensive test of the system. Otto stated preference for the internal, bio-testing group but deferred to Briar."Just get it done!", said Otto. In addition to the circuit board fabrication and involement of an external testing group, manufacturing of the Mock's hand-held case will be completed externally. RFPs for testing and RFP's for the case are to be issued, each with a deadline of ten business days. Per the RFP, it is expected the cases will be delivered within ten days of the initial order.

Octavius Technologies has a preliminary agreement with Gree Board, Inc. to produce the Mock circuit board to specifications. Gree board states they will provide three working boards 20 working days after they receive initial specifications with the initial order. The contract allows Octavius to request one set of revisions to the board. Threee revised boards will be delivered 15 working days after revisions arre submitted with the order. Any additional revisions are subject to further negotiations. Based upon an accepted design, boards can be produced in quantities of up to 15 units every three days.

Briar pulled in the entire team last Saturday to develop a preliminary schedule. There was great concern over the quality assurance of the circuit board. Some on the team argued for inclusion of additional circuit board revisions in the schedule, but Briar was concerned about any delay it might impose stating.  "perfection is not possible. Lets move forward." He was also concerneed about the August 3 deadline and really desires an earlier deadline to include some padding. The team anticipated difficulty in finishing by Monday, August 3, let alone much earlier date,so Friday, July 31 was adopted.

A work breakdown structure preceded activity estimates and a preliminary activity network. The appended table reflects the project network. Briar asked you to create a schedule. He indicated that this project is a such strategic importance that resources should be available in any quantities requireed. He also reminded you of adopted project calendar parameters.

Notes:
1. Because resources are not currently available, the project will begin August 15, 2019.
2. The following holidays are observed: New Years (January 1), Martin Luther King Day (third Monday of January), Memorial Day (last Monday in May), Independence Day on July 4, Labor Day (first Monday in September), Thanksgiving day (fourth Thursday in November) and the Friday following, Christmas Eve and Day (December 24 and 25).
3. If a holiday falls on Saturday, then the preceding Friday will be a day off; if it falls on a Sunday, the Monday following will be a day off.
4. Normal work hours are Monday through Friday, eight hours per day
5. Read the scenario carefully to identify use of lags..

TASK A:
MS Project:
    Open a new, blank project in MS Project. Create a schedule based upon the information provided by the team (uplaoded tasks file). Be sure to consider the impact of working with vendors. Name the file "Task A.mpp".
    
Questions:
    1. Will the project, as planned, meet the July 31, 2020 deadline? What is your prjectd finish date based upon the information?
    2. What activities make up the critical path?
    3. How sensitive is this network? Explain.
